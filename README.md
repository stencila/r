### Install

This package isn't on CRAN yet, but you can install it from this repository using the [`devtools`](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package,

```r
devtools::install_github("stencila/r")
```

You may need to install the `graph` package from Bioconductor if you don't already have it:

```r
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("graph")
```

Then install the package so that other Stencila packages and applications can detect it:

```r
stencila:::register()
```

**Note** This package is not yet compatible with Stencila Desktop 0.28.0. We are working on upgrades to make that possible.

**Note** Installing Stencila package for R may take a while as there are a number of dependencies which need to be installed. 

### Use

This package lets you run R code from inside Stencila Documents. When you start the [Stencila Desktop](https://github.com/stencila/desktop) it will be automatically detect the installed R package and you'll be able to execute R code cells from within your documents.

Check out what people are doing with Stencila and R - [Giulio Valentino Dalla Riva](https://github.com/gvdr) has created Tiny Open Access Data Samples ([TOADS](https://github.com/gvdr/toads/)). These awesome open datasets teach programming and statistics using Stencila. Check out the TOADS!

### Develop

Most development tasks can be run from R, using `make` shortcuts or RStudio keyboard shortcuts.

Run tests                                               | `make test`           | `devtools::test()` or `Ctrl+Shift+T`
Run tests with coverage                                 | `make cover`          | `covr::package_coverage()`

To run test files individually, in R use `test_file`:

```r
library(testthat)
test_file('tests/testthat/test-r-context.R')
```

Unit tests live in the `tests` folder and are mostly written using `testthat`. Documentation is written using `roxygen2` and the documentation site is generated by `pkgdown` into the [`docs`](docs) folder and published on Github pages.

Tests are run on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/stencila/r) and code coverage tracked at [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/stencila/r).
